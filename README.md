Hello all! My name is Damien.
I like to play around with code a lot, usually breaking stuff. I run a YouTube channel and play games a lot. My current most played game is Team Fortress 2. I am also studying for HVAC/R (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning/Refrideration). I am also a Technician HAM, my callsign is KE8NUF.

Where you can reach me:

Twitter: DamienM2005

Steam: GunFighterMan101

Discord: GunFighterMan101#8797

My Main Discord Server: https://discord.gg/tRYafvgDgr


Hope you can find me breaking stuff or possibly hacking (ethically of course)
Have a good day! (or night)
