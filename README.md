Hello all! My name is Damien.
I like to play around with code a lot, usually breaking stuff. I run a YouTube channel for fun, posting whatever I feel is funny or entertaining. I am also EPA-608 Universal Certified. I am a Technician Amateur Radio operator, my callsign is KE8NUF.

Where you can reach me:

Steam: GunFighterMan101 (I don't check this as much)

Discord: GunFighterMan101#8797

My Main Discord Server: https://discord.gg/tRYafvgDgr


Hope you can find me breaking stuff or having fun in the real world.
Have a good day! (or night)
